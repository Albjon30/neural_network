This is a Go-based machine learning framework (a neural network playground) designed to:

✅ Load data (like Sonar)
✅ Train neural networks (Single Layer Perceptron, Multilayer Perceptron, RNN)
✅ Evaluate performance (using cross-validation and random subsampling)
✅ Output logs showing progress and accuracy

We're running a Go-based custom neural network library that:

    Loads sonar data

    Trains a couple of different neural networks

    Logs their performance

    Uses classic datasets and validation methods
